### Our Client: MEBA
The Marine Engineersâ€™ Beneficial Association (henceforth referred to as MEBA) is a United States-based maritime labor union. They work with maritime employees across the country, pushing for fair workplace practices and providing an important facet of national defense. MEBA operates a job distribution network, acting as the middleman for the routing of maritime jobs to qualified candidates.

### The Problem:
As the association continues to grow larger and larger, the technologies that they previously relied on start to show their limitations. As such technologies were not designed with MEBA's functionality in mind, the association started to encounter various inconveniences that could become a larger problem down the line.

### The Solution:
This project is tailored to address MEBA's problem, MaritimeAssign is a website that is designed to streamline all processes for all MEBA's employees. It will preserve key functions of previously used technologies while also implementing new features that seek to improve security as well as general quality of life.
